           1- when String reference variables are assigned to String literals 
           2- when String reference variables are assigned to String Objects
           As you will see, the equality operator, ==, compares the two references
           to see if they point to the same Object, which in case 1 they do. Make
           sure you use the debugger to see this. In case 2, they point to different
           Objects. When the "new" operator is invoked in case 2, memory is allocated 
           to a new String object. In case 1, the reference is assigned to the same 
           literal value, which Java handles by creating a single String Object.
           This is more efficient, but be careful about what behavior you expect.
           Always use the equals method when comparing for lexicographic eqivalence.
